Angular 2 is cross platform we can develop web application, mobile application as well
Angular 2 work with type script of Microsoft
Why angular: 
The code will be cleaner, More powerful application, faster and simpler
The main parts are:
1 module: every application has one module that is called as ngmodule and we called it as Appmodule.
2. component : we can create multiple components, each component has it own view and can be controlled.
3. template: it is a html component which is used to make view for the application.
4. metadata: information given to angular to tell them they are realted togetherb 
5. databinding
This is present in between component and template,These are two types 
Property binding 
Event binding
6. Service: this is for using resusable code, for example we can use one logic in ten different components.
7. directive: they are built in ones, like ng modules or custome directives can be created
8. dependency injection: we can use this with the services to use the resuasable components.
Displaying Data:
Interpolation: we can display property of components using the property name in the view template enclosed with double braces
